                Throughout 19th-century Europe, political and economic forces helped to dramatically 
                alter the European continent in a manner that forever changed the countries and people
                 that inhabited them. In less than a century, the absolutist ideals of the Old Regime
                  started to wither away as revolutionary ideals of freedom and democracy attempted 
                  to take hold across Europe. Industrialization, with its powerful economic connections,
                   greatly fueled these revolutions through the development of both social strife and
                    inequality. Moreover, nationalist sentiment and imperialism directly contributed to
                     these changes through their promotion of racism and competition between the powerful
                     nation-states that emerged. However, revolution, industrialization, and 
                     imperialism did not always follow a consistent or steady pattern. Rather, 
                     they differed quite significantly depending upon the country and people involved 
                    during their progression. As a result, Europeans experienced uneven and sporadic
                     waves of change across the long nineteenth-century.
